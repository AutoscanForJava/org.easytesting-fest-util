Common utilities used in all [FEST](http://fest.easytesting.org) modules.

To avoid feature creep, the scope of this project is to contain utilities needed in two or more FEST modules.

Code in this module is considered for internal use only. It is not meant to be used by end-users. We do not guarantee backwards compatibility.
